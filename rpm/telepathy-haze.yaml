Description: | 

    telepathy-haze is a connection manager built around libpurple, the core of
    Pidgin (formerly Gaim), as a Summer of Code project under the Pidgin umbrella.
    Ultimately, any protocol supported by libpurple will be supported by
    telepathy-haze; for now, XMPP, MSN and AIM are known to work acceptably, and
    others will probably work too.
